## Running fullstack DRLS REMS Dockerized set up

You can find complete end-to-end fullstack set up guides for DRLS REMS at the following links:

[Developer Environment Set Up](DockerDevSetupGuideForMacOS.md) - Follow this guide if you are a developer and intend on making code changes to the DRLS REMS project. This guide follows a much more technical set up process.
    
[Production Environement Set Up](DockerProdSetupGuideForMacOS.md) - Follow this guide if you are not a developer and do not intend on making code changes to the DRLS REMS project. This guide covers two options for running DRLS REMS, both of which are less techincal than the developer set up.
